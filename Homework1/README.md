# Homework 1

In this assignment, you need to choose a dataset and create at least three visualizations leading to two or more  nsights of the data. 
For visualization, you will use [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/) (JavaScript). 
his is an individual assignment, so you may not work in groups. 
Your final submission will take the form of a report including the visualizations you created and the description of the insights you gained from the visualizations.

An example for visualization and analysis of a multidimensional dataset can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/d/2600cf5224a01f25)

* An Observable Tutorial:  [Five-Minute Introduction to Observable](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/five-minute-introduction) 

### Step 1: Choose a dataset from the list below
* [LAX Passenger Counts by Terminal](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Los-Angeles-International-Airport-Passenger-Traffi/g3qu-7q2u)
* [Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am)
* [List of Historical Ballot Measures in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/List-of-Historical-Ballot-Measures/xzie-ixjw)
* [Louisville Restaurant Health Inspections](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/restaurant-inspection-data)

##### Loading the data
For Observable notebook and Tableau, you can attach or load the dataset as CSV files.
* After you make an account and create a new notebok look for the (...) which reveal notebook actions located next to Publish and Like Icons in the top right.
* Click (...) and select file attachments to add in your dataset.

### Step 3: Process the data
Next, you are going to load the chosen dataset to your selected tool for processing and visualization. 
To process and transform the data for analysis, we recommend the following:
* [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) (declarative grammars for data transformations and visualization)

### Step 4: Analyze and visualize the data
For visualizing the data, we recommend the following:
* [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) for Observable Notebook
* [D3.js](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery)

### Example
An example of visualization and analysis of a mutlidimensional dataset can be found in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/d/2600cf5224a01f25)

### Requirements
You need to create at least three different visualizations, and you need to describe at least two insights (e.g. useful or important information) from your visualizations. 
With the Observable notebooks, you can use the "Text" blocks to write down your insights.

### Submission
For Observable notebooks, enable link sharing for your notebook and submit the link to HW1 in UCD Canvas.
